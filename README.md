# Restaurant Pricing
Don't know how much a meal is going to cost? It's obvious, run a Monte-Carlo simulation.

So you're going to Edibles on University Avenue in the Neighborhood of the Arts. It's a casual dining spot with eclectic eats and a location with a history. The restaurant features tall tin-roof ceilings, original hardwoods, and a unique location in the flat-iron building.

The following code is a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the probability distribution function for the price of a meal at Edibles, but tailored to your specific preferences and to Edibles selection of menu items. I've used this code to set the gift amount. The gift card amount is set based on the 50% confidence interval and the additional cash is set based on the 90% confidence interval. Meaning, if you go out to eat at Edibles every day of the year for the next 273 years (100,000 times), this gift card and cash would cover the whole meal, tip, and tax 90% of the time.
